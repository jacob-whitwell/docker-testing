# Baban's Repository

## About
This repository will be to show Baban Cariad how to create a Docker container from scratch. This will just be a cut down version of what's available on the official [Docker Labs tutorial](https://www.docker.com/101-tutorial/). The end result will be a multi-containerised application (a.k.a microservices), where our container will use a *volume* to create persistent database data.

This repository will first complete the Docker tutorial, and then be chopped and changed appropriately into a Flask application.
